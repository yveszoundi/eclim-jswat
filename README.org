#+TITLE:README

* Overview
Primitive [[https://github.com/nlfiedler/jswat][JSwat]] 2.40 integration for [[https://github.com/senny/emacs-eclim][emacs-eclim]].

=emacs-eclim= doesn't provide any debugger support.

* Notes

- Only JSwat 2.40 is supported. Newer versions of JSwat seem to use [[https://netbeans.org/features/platform/][NetBeans RCP platform]] and there doesn't seem to be a way to pass commands to JSwat from a shell invocation.

- Breakpoints can only be set within JSwat.

- The only thing that this plugin does is the following:
 - Setup the classpath for JSwat.
 - Setup the source path for JSwat (From the [[https://eclipse.org/home/index.php][Eclipse]] =.classpath= project file).
 - Setup the main class to run.
 - Setup the file to edit upon when JSwat is launched.
