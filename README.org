#+TITLE:README

* Overview
Primitive [[https://github.com/nlfiedler/jswat][JSwat]] 2.40 integration for [[https://github.com/senny/emacs-eclim][emacs-eclim]].

=emacs-eclim= doesn't provide any debugger support.

* Notes

- Only JSwat 2.40 is supported. Newer versions of JSwat seem to use [[https://netbeans.org/features/platform/][NetBeans RCP platform]] and there doesn't seem to be a way to pass commands to JSwat from a shell invocation.

- Breakpoints can only be set within JSwat.

- The only thing that this plugin does is the following:
 - Setup the classpath for JSwat.
 - Setup the source path for JSwat (From the [[https://eclipse.org/home/index.php][Eclipse]] =.classpath= project file).
 - Setup the main class to run.
 - Setup the file to edit upon when JSwat is launched.

* Installation

** El-get
Add the following to your =el-get-sources=.

=(:name eclim-jswat :type github :pkgname "yveszoundi/eclim-jswat")=

** Cask
Add the following to your =Cask= file.

=(depends-on "eclim-jswat" :git "https://github.com/yveszoundi/eclim-jswat")=

** Manual
Download =eclim-jswat.el= and add it to a folder within your Emacs =load-path=.
See for reference the relevant [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Search.html][Emacs Manual page]] for details.

* Usage

** Pre-requisites
You must set the main class of the =eclim= managed project.
The preference variable is =org.eclim.java.run.mainclass=.

I use the following function to achieve it:

: (defun ers-eclim-project-set-as-main-class ()
:       (interactive)
:       (if (not (string= major-mode "java-mode"))
:           (message "Sorry cannot run current buffer."))
:       (compile (concat eclim-executable
:                        " -command project_setting"
:                        " -p " eclim--project-name
:                        " -s " "org.eclim.java.run.mainclass"
:                       " -v " (eclim-package-and-class))))

** Running the command

Add the following to your Emacs =init= file and replace =eclim-jswat-path=
with the location of your JSwat 2.0 installation.

: (eval-after-load "eclim-jswat"
: (progn
:  (require 'eclim-jswat)
:    '(setq eclim-jswat-path (expand-file-name "~/Downloads/jswat-2.40"))))

You should now be able to run jswat via =M-x eclim-jswat-run=. 
You can bind it to a keystroke of your liking for convenience.
